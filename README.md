## About Project:

### THIS PROJECT IS UNDERGOING A REFACTOR
After proof of concept (API usage & data testing) I decided to overhaul the codebase with `styled-components` and theming. UI is far from complete whilst I get the theme components setup.

This is a weather app created using an API for GEOLocation and an API for weather tracking. Visit @ [https://weather.mmcoding.dev](https://weather.mmcoding.dev).

##### Languages used:
- React
